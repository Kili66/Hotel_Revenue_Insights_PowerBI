# Hotel_Revenue_Insights_PowerBI
This is a GitHub repository for a Power BI project that aims to provide insights into the revenue performance of hotels. The project uses data from the Hotel Booking Demand dataset, which contains information about bookings made in hotels in India. The project consists of three main components:

* A Power BI data model that transforms, cleans, and enriches the data using Power Query and DAX.
* A Power BI report that visualizes the key metrics and trends related to hotel revenue, such as average daily rate, occupancy rate, revenue per available room, 
 cancellation rate, market segment, customer type, lead time, and booking seasonality.
* A Power BI dashboard that summarizes the main findings and insights from the report, and allows users to interact with the data using filters and slicers.
* The project aims to answer some of the following business questions:

* What is the revenue performance of the hotel?
* Which market segments and customer types generate the most revenue?
* How does the lead time affect the revenue and cancellation rate?
* How does the seasonality affect the revenue and occupancy rate?
* What are the main factors that influence the average daily rate?
* The project is intended to demonstrate the capabilities of Power BI as a tool for data analysis and visualization, as well as to provide some useful insights for hotel managers and owners who want to optimize their revenue strategy. The project is not affiliated with or endorsed by any of the hotels or data sources used in the dataset.

* To view the project, you can either download the .pbix file from this repository and open it with Power BI Desktop.
